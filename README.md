## About Me
I'm a 14-year-old beginner coder with a dream to become a billionaire one day. I'm currently working on a project called Agriconnect, which aims to bridge the gap between farmers and consumers. I enjoy learning new technologies and contributing to exciting projects. I'm also from Trinity College Kandy and love keeping my personality covered from others.
